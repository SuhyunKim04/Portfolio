# Portfolio


##Suffering

The _suffering_ I experienced while creating my web portfolio were design and bootstrap.

I have been thinking about unique designs and structure of contents. I wanted to show my portfolio home

page like cartoon, so I arranged simpsons as background image. 

The web page I spent the most time on was the photography page 

because I wanted to display the pictures in zigzags Therefore, using bootstrap is the best way to 

express what I wnated to make for.

While making my own web portfolio, I thought it was still insufficient to think about 

the structure and create a cool page. Thus, I need to practice any page as many as I can.
